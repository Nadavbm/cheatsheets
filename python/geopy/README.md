How to Convert Degrees Minutes Seconds to Decimal Degrees
First of all let's take a look at the symbols:
Â° : degree
' : minute
" : second

1 minute is equal to 60 seconds.
1 degree is equal to 1 hour, that is equal to 60 minutes or 3600 seconds.

To calculate decimal degrees, we use the DMS to decimal degree formula below:
Decimal Degrees = degrees + (minutes/60) + (seconds/3600)

DD = d + (min/60) + (sec/3600)


Calculate longtitude:

To convert a given latitude into the approximate distance in miles between 1 longitude at that point:

(90 - Decimal degrees) * Pi / 180 * 69.172

Note: if the answer is a minus number, multiply it by -1

In the example given the calculation is as follows:

(90 - 51.43567) * 3.1415927 / 180 * 69.172 with the answer being ~47 miles.
