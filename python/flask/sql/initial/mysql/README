This will use mysql 5.6 image.
To coonect to this image use docker compose and test by this from your host:
install mysql client
mysql -h 192.168.178.23 -u root -p

All details in docker-compose.

Use IP and not localhost in you python code:
mysql+pymysql://root:password@192.168.178.23/myapp
Don't try localhost here because the connection will be refused (docker will search itself...)
